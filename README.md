# BlackBoard-Automation-System
This is a program that I created just for fun to automate my college classes if I was ever busy. It works on for Chandigarh University but I guess support for other Colleges can be added with some time.

Instructions:

1. Download your timetable from UIMS in "XML Format" (this is important!), rename it to "TimeTable.xml" and paste it in the same folder as the program.
2. Download the chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and place it in the same folder as the program.
3. Run the "TheProxinator.py" file.
4. When it asks for the chromedriver.exe path, copy and paste the path of the "chromedriver.exe" file in the folder to the console.
5. Input your UID and Password.
6. And that's all! The program will automatically open a chrome window and open your class session.

Note 1: When you run the program for the very first time, you will have to accept the audio and video checks as well as dismiss the BB Tour. After the first run it will save the cookies so you wont have to do it every time.

Note 2: YOU NEED TO START THE PROGRAM ATLEAST 20 MINUTES BEFORE YOUR CLASS, ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK! DON'T BLAME ME IF YOUR CLASS DOES NOT OPEN! ALSO, THIS PROGRAM WILL ONLY OPEN YOUR CLASS SESSION. IT WILL NOT REPLY OR MARK ANY ANSWER FOR THE MCQ THAT THE TEACHER GIVES.

You can open and leave your program overnight if you want. It will automatically open the class when the time comes!

Enjoy and do give the feedback!

Final Note: This project was just for fun! I take no responsibility for your attendance if you get caught using this program. Also this program in no means any kind of insult of Chandigarh University or its staff.
